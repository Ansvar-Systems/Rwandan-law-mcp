CHAPTER
II:
EXECUTION
PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS
Article 3: Receipt of payment orders
OF
It shall be deemed that the payment service
provider received a payment order at the point
in time when the payment order was

transmitted in the manner specified in the
payment service contract.
The point in time of receipt is the time when
the payer's payment service provider received
a payment order transmitted by the payer, the
payee or by the payer through the payee.
Specifically, the point in time of receipt of
payment order is defined as follows:
1° For Credit Transfers given in paper
form: when the form containing the
payment order is submitted directly at
a branch counter: the time it
physically submitted to the teller;
2° For Credit Transfers carried out via
the electronic services made available
to the payment service user by the
payment service provider: after the
information required for payment
order execution is submitted, when the
payment service user receives
electronic confirmation of its receipt
by the payment service provider;

3° For Direct Debits: as from the receipt
of the files transferred by the payment
service provider of the payee/creditor
of the payer containing the payment
orders to be executed.
If a payment order is received after the close
of a business day or after the appropriate cut-
off time, the receiving institution may treat the
payment order as received at the opening of
the next business day.
If the payment service user initiating the
payment order and its payment service
provider have agreed that the execution of the
payment order should be started on a specific
day or at the end of a certain period or on the
day on which the payer has placed funds at the
payment service provider's disposal, then the
agreed date shall be deemed to be the point in
time of receipt. If the agreed date does not fall
on a business day for the payment service
provider, then paragraph 3 (paragraph above)
shall apply.

Article 4: Refusal of a payment order
The payment service provider shall not be
allowed to refuse the execution of an
authorised payment order, irrespective of
whether the payment order was initiated by
payer, or by a payment initiation service
provider or by or through a payee, unless:
1° the payment account to be debited is
insufficiently funded;
2° there are doubts about the authenticity
of the order;
3° the order is completed or sent to the
payment
service
provider,
incompletely or irregularly;
4° the payment service provider is
prevented executing the payment
order pursuant to a public order, legal
or statutory provision;
5° the order breaches provisions
stipulated in the specific agreements
between the payment service provider
and the payment service user.

The payment service provider shall notify the
payment service user of the refusal to execute
the payment order and, if possible, of the
reasons therefor, and of the procedure for
correcting the mistakes that led to the refusal,
unless such notification is prohibited by the
Law.
If the payment service provider refuses to
execute the payment order in accordance with
this Article, the payment order shall be
deemed not to have been received.
Article 5: Irrevocability of payment order
The payment service user shall not revoke
payment order once it has been received by
the payer’s payment service provider, unless
otherwise specified in this Article.
When the payment transaction was initiated
by a payment initiation service provider or by
or through the payee, the payer may no longer
revoke the payment order once the payer has
communicated its approval for executing the
payment transaction to the payee. When the
payment transaction was initiated by
payment initiation service, then revocation of

the payment order is not permissible, once the
payer has granted its approval for initiation.
Notwithstanding the above, the payer may,
however, in the case of a direct debit revoke
the payment order, at latest by the end of the
business day preceding the agreed debit date
for the payment order.
However, the payer may revoke a payment
order at any time before may revoke
payment order at the latest by the end of the
business day preceding the agreed day.
After the point in time of irrevocability
pursuant to paragraph 1 and 2 of this Article
has been reached, a payment order may only
be revoked, if this has been agreed upon
between the payment service user and the
payment service provider. However, in the
case of what provided in paragraph 2 of this
Article, the consent of the beneficiary is
necessary.
Article 6: Transfer for the full amount
The payment service provider may levy on the
payment service user only those charges
related to the execution of payment
transactions of which it informed the user in

advance in accordance with the framework
contract.
The payment service user shall pay the
charges referred to in paragraph One of this
Article to the payment service provider with
whom it concluded a payment service
contract. The payer and the payee shall each
pay these charges to their respective payment
service providers.
The payer's payment service provider, the
payee's payment service provider and any
intermediaries of the payment service
provider shall transfer the full amount of the
payment order and shall not deduct charges
from the amount transferred.
By way of derogation from paragraph 3 of this
Article, the payee and its payment service
provider may however agree that the payment
service provider shall be allowed to deduct its
charges from the amount transferred, before
the payment service provider credits the
payee. In this case, the full amount of the
payment transaction and charges must be
itemised in the information given to the payee.
If the payment transaction is initiated by the
payer, the payer's payment service provider

shall ensure that the payee receives the full
amount of the payment transaction less the
charges pursuant to paragraph 4 of this
Article. If the payment transaction is initiated
by or through the payee, the payee's payment
service provider shall ensure that the payee
receives the full amount of the payment
transaction.
Article 7: Execution period and availability
The payer's payment service provider shall
ensure that the funds involved in the payment
transaction are transferred to the account of
the payee's payment service provider at latest
at the end of the business day on the day of the
point in time of receipt.
The payee’s payment service provider must
ensure that the amount of payment transaction
is at the payee’s disposal and value date
immediately pursuant to Article 8, when from
the side of the payee's payment service
provider there is no currency conversion:

1° if the amount of the payment
transaction for the payee has been
credited to the payee's payment
service provider’s account or if the
payee's payment service provider
received the amount in another way;
2° if the payee's payment service
provider received all information
necessary for crediting the payee’s
payment account or making funds
available to the payee.
This obligation shall also apply for payments
within a payment service provider.
Provided that no payment account is held at
the payee's payment service provider, then the
payee's payment service provider shall make
funds available within the time limit pursuant
to paragraph 1 that has received the funds for
the payee.
In the event that the payment order has been
initiated by or through the payee to the payer's
payment service provider, the payee's
payment service provider shall transmit this

payment transaction to the payer's payment
service provider within the time limits agreed
between the payee and its payment service
provider.
In the case of direct debits, the payment order
shall be executed to the payer's payment
service provider promptly to ensure
settlement on the agreed due date.
If funds have been credited to the account of
the payee’s payment service provider on the
day which is not a business day for that
provider, it shall be deemed that the payee’s
payment service provider received the funds
on the next business day.
In the case of cash being deposited into
payment account with a payment service
provider in the currency of that payment
account, the payment service provider shall
ensure that:
1° in the case that the account is held by
a consumer, the amount shall be made
available and value dated immediately
after the point of time of the receipt of
the funds;

2° in the case that the account is not held
by a consumer, the amount shall be
made available and value dated at the
latest on the same business day after
receipt of the funds.
Article 8: Value date
The payer’s payment service provider shall
ensure that the debit value date for the payer's
payment account in connection with the
execution of a payment transaction shall be
the same as or later than the point in time at
which the amount of the payment transaction
is debited from that payment account.
The payee’s payment service provider shall
ensure that the credit value date for the
payee's payment account in connection with
the execution of a payment transaction shall
be no later than the business day on which the
amount of the payment transaction is credited
to the payee's payment service provider's
account.

Article 9: Transmission of payment orders
through payment system or other
communication system
If a payment order addressed to a receiving
institution is transmitted to a payment system
or other third-party communication system
for transmittal to the institution, the system is
deemed to be an agent of the sender for the
purpose of transmitting the payment order to
the institution.
A payment service provider shall not avoid
any obligation to its customer by reason only
of the fact that it is a party to a shared payment
system, and that another party to the system
had failed to fulfill its obligations under this
regulation.
