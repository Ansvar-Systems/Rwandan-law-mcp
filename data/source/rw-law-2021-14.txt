after hearing from the Inspectorate General
of Courts if there be, and after hearing

delivered by hand to the Secretariat of the
Supreme Court against acknowledgement of
receipt or by electronic means. In case the
application is made by electronic means, the
recipient of the mail uses the same means to
acknowledge receipt of the mail. The
application letter is addressed to the
President of the High Council of the
Judiciary who in turn submits it to the
Disciplinary Committee. The date of hand

delivery of the letter or the submission date
in case the electronic means was used is the
basis of calculating the time referred to in
Paragraph One of this Article.
The application for review suspends the
execution of the concerned decision. If the
review is effected, the High Council of the
Judiciary is reconvened, the accused person
and witnesses having been duly summoned if

review is sought.

judicial personnel who applies for review
could not know its existence and found it

after the decision was made or was not
enable to access during the process of

review of a decision of the High Council of
the Judiciary is two (2) months starting from
the date of discovery of the fact giving rise to
