or order to pay a specified amount
of money;

time;

Article 5: Signature on a negotiable
instrument
If a negotiable instrument is required to be
signed by any person, it is not necessary
that the drawer signs it with his or her own
hand, but it is sufficient if it is signed by
another person authorised by him or her.
A signature by proxy on a negotiable
instrument operates as notice that the agent
has a limited authority to sign, and the
principal is only bound by the signature if
the agent, in so signing, was acting within
the actual limits of his authority.

Article 6: Validity of a negotiable
instrument issued by a legal entity
A negotiable instrument issued by a legal
entity is valid if duly signed and sealed
with the seal of the legal entity.
However, a cheque issued by a legal entity
is not invalidated by the fact that it is not
sealed with the seal of such an entity.
Article 7: Payment time for a negotiable
instrument
The day for payment of a negotiable
instrument is the working day of the
financial institution.
If a financial institution is not open for
business on a working day, the day for
payment of a negotiable instrument is
postponed to the following working day
unless provide otherwise in a negotiable
instrument.
A negotiable instrument to be paid on
demand cannot be presented and accepted
or be paid on the day a financial institution
is not open for business.

The payee has no claim on the pretext that
the financial institution is closed on
working day.
Article 8: Admissibility of evidence of an
unpaid negotiable instrument
A negotiable instrument that is not
honoured or its copy signed by a notary is
considered as evidence in a court.
The provisions of Paragraph One of this
Article do not apply to cheque.
Article 9: Negotiable instrument paid on
condition
An instrument payable on condition or
depending on uncertain event does not
constitute a negotiable instrument.
Article 10: Payee of a negotiable
instrument
A negotiable instrument is payable either
to order or to bearer.

Article 11: Payment of a negotiable
instrument to multiple payee
A negotiable instrument may be made
payable to multiple payees jointly. It may
also be made payable to one or several of
the payees.
Each payee endorses the negotiable
instrument. However, the manager of
legal entity or the person authorized to
represent others are the endorsers of
negotiable instrument.
Article 12: Prohibiting endorsement of
negotiable instrument
A negotiable instrument that contains
words prohibiting endorsement, is valid
between the parties thereto but is not
negotiable.
Article 13: Negotiable
payable to bearer
instrument
A negotiable instrument is payable to
bearer where it is expressed to be so
payable, or where the last endorsement is
blank.

Article 14: Indication of payee

face with reasonable certainty.
Article 15: Negotiable
payable to order
instrument

cannot contain words prohibiting its

on demand
A negotiable instrument is payable on
demand if:
1° it is expressed to be payable on
demand or at sight or on
presentation;
2° no time for payment is expressed.

If a negotiable instrument is issued and
accepted or endorsed when overdue, it is
regarded as if the issuer had intended for
to be accepted or endorsed as payable on
demand.
Article 17: Negotiable instrument
payable at a determined time
A negotiable instrument payable at
determined time is payable:
1° at a fixed period after a determined
date;
2° on or after a fixed or determinable
future time specified therein;
3° at a fixed period after the
occurrence of a specified event,
which is certain to happen, though
the time of happening is uncertain.
Article 18: Negotiable instrument made
in Rwanda
A negotiable instrument is considered to be
negotiable instrument made in Rwanda if
is both drawn and payable in Rwanda.

A negotiable instrument that does not
indicate the place where it is drawn or
payable is used as a negotiable instrument
drawn in Rwanda.
Article
19:
instrument
Foreign
negotiable

made payable contrary to provisions of
Article 18 of this Law is considered as
foreign negotiable instrument.
Article 20: Specific amount of money

negotiable instrument is shown must be
clearly indicated, including possible
interests, stated instalments, default
interests and the rate of exchange if need
be.

details to be mentioned on a negotiable
instrument referred to in Paragraph One of
this Article do not apply to a cheque.

Article 21: Amount of money in words
and figure
On a negotiable instrument, the amount of
money is expressed both in words and
figures.
If the amount of money for which the
negotiable instrument is drawn is
expressed differently in figures and words,
the sum denoted by the words is the
amount payable.
Article 22: True date
A date written on a negotiable instrument
is considered to be the true date.
The true date is the date of the drawing,
acceptance or endorsement, unless
otherwise proved.
In any case, a negotiable instrument cannot
go beyond its due date as specified by this
Law.
Article 23: Grace period
Where a negotiable instrument is not
payable on demand of the payee, the payee

is given a three (3) day grace period and the
negotiable instrument is payable on the last
day of grace. If the last day of grace falls
on a public holiday, it is postponed to the
following working day.
The grace period does not apply to the
cheque.
Article 24: Computation of the last day
of payment of a negotiable instrument
In computation of days of payment of
negotiable instruments, the day of issuance
is not considered but the day of payment is
considered.
Article 25: Due date of payment
Where a negotiable instrument is payable
on a due date in a month or on dates of
different months, the day determined in
each month is considered as the last day.
The negotiable instrument is payable on
due date plus a three (3) day grace period
unless provided otherwise.

Article 26: Basis for a negotiable
instrument
A negotiable instrument is based on
direct contract, a simple obligation or
debt based on an obligation payable on
demand or in a determined period.
Article 27: Holder of a negotiable
instrument for value
A bearer of a negotiable instrument is
considered to be a holder for value with
regard to the drawer or endorser.
Where any bearer of a negotiable
instrument has a lien on it arising from
contract, he or she is considered to be its
holder for value but to the extent of the
amount of such a lien.
Article 28: Holder of a negotiable
instrument in due course
A bearer is considered to be a holder in due
course who has received a negotiable
instrument, complete and regular on face
if:

1° he or she became the holder of
before the due date and without
notice of a refusal of acceptance or
refusal of payment;
2° he or she received the negotiable
instrument in good faith and for
value and that at the time of its
negotiation, he or she had no notice
of any defect with regard to the
endorser.
Article 29:
instrument
Defective
negotiable
A negotiable instrument is considered to be
a defective negotiable instrument where
obtaining it or acceptance thereof was
characterised by fraud, duress or based on
other unlawful means.
Article 30: Rights of a holder of
negotiable instrument whose name is not
mentioned
A holder, whether for value or not, who
received his or her negotiable instrument
from a bearer in due course who is not
characterised by fraud or illegality
affecting its ownership, may claim for
payment by one or all who accepted the

negotiable instrument of whom it is evident
that they endorsed it to each other prior to
that holder who fulfils the conditions.
Article 31: Negotiable
presumed for value
instrument
Any person whose signature appears on
negotiable instrument is considered to have
become a party thereto for value, in the
absence of evidence to the contrary.
Article 32: Burden of proof in case of
liability
A holder of a negotiable instrument is
considered to be a holder in due course in
the absence of evidence to the contrary.
However, if, in an action for acceptance,
issue or subsequent negotiation of the
negotiable instrument was characterised by
fraud, duress or other illegality, the burden
of proof lies with the holder unless he or
she proves that the negotiable instrument
was received from the prior bearer in good
faith or legality.

Article 33: Negotiation of a negotiable
instrument by endorsement
A negotiable instrument is negotiated
when it is endorsed in such a manner that
the holder has the rights thereto.
Article 34: Negotiation of a negotiable
instrument by delivery
A negotiable instrument payable to bearer
is negotiated by delivery to payer.
Article 35: Negotiation of a negotiable
instrument payable to order
A negotiable instrument payable to order is
negotiated by endorsement.
Article 36: Value for which a negotiable
instrument is endorsed
An endorsement of negotiable instrument
is carried out on the entire value of the
negotiable instrument. Non-compliance of
this requirement renders the negotiable
instrument non-negotiable.

Article 37: Allonge or copy of
negotiable instrument
An endorsement may be done on allonge or
copy of a negotiable instrument and it is
considered to be written on the original
negotiable instrument itself.
However, when the endorsement referred
to in Paragraph One of this Article is made
outside Rwanda, it is valid only
recognised by the country where an
endorsement is done.
Article 38: Order of endorsees
Where there are many endorsees on
negotiable instrument, the rights of each
endorsee are determined in the order in
which he or she appears on the negotiable
instrument until the contrary is proved.

Article 39: Mode of indorsement of
negotiable instrument
An endorsement of a negotiable instrument
may be done by indicating the indorsee or
not.
If no name is indicated, it is considered as
if the negotiable instrument is payable to
any bearer.
If the name of the last endorsee is
indicated, he or she is the only person to be
paid.
Article 40: Restrictive endorsement
A negotiable instrument is restrictively
endorsed by using the words, including
“Pay ... only”, or “Pay ... for the account of
...”, or “Pay ..., or order, for collection”.
A restrictive endorsement gives the
endorsee the right to receive payment of
the bill and to sue any party that his or her
endorser could have sued, but gives him or
her no power to transfer his or her rights as

endorsee unless the negotiable instrument
expressly authorises him or her to do so.
If a restrictive endorsement authorises
further transfer, all subsequent endorsees
take the bill with the same rights and
subject to the same liabilities as the first
endorsee
under
the
restrictive
endorsement.
Article
41:
instrument
Overdue
negotiable
A negotiable instrument is negotiated
before it is overdue. However, the
negotiation of an overdue negotiable
instrument is subject to such other
circumstances and reasons as provided for
by this Law. In that case, the payee can
neither transfer nor endorse it with more
rights than those attached thereto.
A negotiable instrument payable on
demand is considered to be due when it is
still in circulation while overdue and where

exceeding the date can be reasonably
justified.
Article 42: Rights and powers of
bearer of negotiable instrument
The rights and powers of the bearer of
negotiable instrument are the following:
1° a bearer may file a case related to the
negotiable instrument in court in his or
her own name;
2° a bearer in due course may not incur
any liability for any defect of
instrument of prior endorsers or be
summoned to appear with regard to
personal defenses among prior
endorsers themselves. However, he or
she may enforce payment against all
parties to the negotiable instrument;
3° negotiation of a defective negotiable
instrument made by a prior bearer to
bearer in due course allows the
endorsee to obtain a good and complete
title to the negotiable instrument;

4° payment of a negotiable instrument
effected in due course remains valid
even when the instrument is defective.
Article 43: Presentation of the
negotiable instrument for payment
A negotiable instrument is duly presented
for payment. If not so presented, the drawer
or endorsers is discharged.
Presentation of a negotiable instrument for
payment is made upon its exhibition to the
payer by the bearer or a person authorised
by the bearer to receive payment on his or
her behalf.
Article 44: Place authorised for
presentation of a negotiable instrument
The place authorised for presentation of
negotiable instrument for payment may be:
1° the place of payment specified on
the negotiable instrument or the
place of acceptance;

2° the address of the drawee or
acceptor specified in the negotiable
instrument if no place of payment
or acceptance is specified;
3° any place of residence of the
drawee or acceptor, his or her last
place of residence or his or her
known address.
Article 45: Late presentation of
negotiable instrument for payment
A person who claims payment of
negotiable instrument cannot be held liable
for any delay caused by an unforseeable
event or event of force majeure against the
bearer. However, it must be proved that the
delay is not imputable to default,
misconduct or negligence of the bearer.
When the cause of delay ceases to operate,
presentation of a negotiable instrument for
payment is made with reasonable
diligence.

Article 46: Instances where presentation
of a negotiable instrument is waived
Presentation of a negotiable instrument for
payment is waived if:
1° requesting for payment of the
instrument as indicated on the
negotiable instrument cannot be
effected;
2° the payer is fictitious;
3° it is proved that the payer or
acceptor is no longer bound to pay
the negotiable instrument and that
the drawer has no reason to believe
that the instrument would be paid
presented;
4° with respect to an endorser, if it is
known that the instrument was
made or accepted for the
accommodation of that endorser
and the drawer has no reason to
believe that the instrument would
be paid;

5° there is a waiver of presentation of
a negotiable instrument by the
bearer;
6° regarding the cheque, the financial
institution which is bound to
payment becomes insolvent.
Article 47: Absence of specified place for
payment of a negotiable instrument
If the place of presentation for payment or
acceptance is not specified in the
negotiable instrument, the presentation for
acceptance is not necessary in order to
render the acceptor liable.
Article 48: Negotiable instrument which
specifies place of payment
If a place of payment or acceptance is
clearly specified, the acceptor cannot
invoke the fact that the negotiable
instrument was not presented for
acceptance in order to disregard his or her
obligations unless otherwise stipulated.

Article 49: Delivery of a negotiable
instrument after payment
When a negotiable instrument is paid, the
bearer delivers it to the payer.
Article 50: Negotiable instrument
dishonoured by non-payment

negotiable instrument

dishonoured by non-acceptance or by non-
payment, notice of dishonour is given to

the drawer or the endorser. The drawer or
the endorser to whom the notice is not
given is not held liable.
Article 52: Requirements for validity of
notice of dishonour of a negotiable
instrument
Notice of dishonouring a negotiable
instrument is valid if done:
1° not later than
working day;
following
2° by the bearer or his or her proxy, by

instrument;
3° by a potential proxy, if there is or

case of death of the drawer or
endorser;
4° by one of the drawers or endorsers,
if there are several but are not
partners in business, unless one of
the

them has authority to represent
others.
Article 53: Mode of notice of dishonour
of a negotiable instrument
The notice of dishonour of a negotiable
instrument is given by:
1° notifying the concerned party or his
or her proxy;
2° a proxy in his or her own name or
in the name of any party entitled to
give notice, whether that party is
his or her principal or not;
3° written
or
by
verbal
communication in such a manner as
to specify clearly the instrument
dishonoured either for payment or
acceptance.
Lack of clear description of the instrument
does not invalidate the notice unless the
party to whom the notice is given is misled
by it.

Article 54: Form of notice
A notice does not need to be written. It is
sufficient if the dishonoured negotiable
instrument is returned to the drawer or
endorser.
Article 55: Notice to prior endorsers
Each person concerned with the negotiable
instrument and who was legally informed
that it is dishonoured, he or she is given the
same period of time as is provided in

prior endorsers.
Article 56: Place for the notice of
dishonour of a negotiable instrument
A notice of dishonour of a negotiable
instrument payable in Rwanda is
sufficiently given if it is addressed in due
time to any party or person entitled to the
negotiable instrument, at his or her
customary address or place of residence or
at the place at which a negotiable
instrument is signed, or any other place

specified by the person concerned by the
negotiable instrument if he or she has
signed it.
The notice is considered to have been duly
served if it is deposited at the post office or
through any other recognised means of
communication, and it is done on the day
of presentation of the negotiable
instrument for payment or on the following
working day.
The notice is not invalid due to death of the
party to whom it is addressed.
Article 57: Loss of notice made through
means of communication
A notice of dishonour of a negotiable
instrument which is duly addressed
through the post office or any recognised
means of communication continues to be
valid even if the notice of dishonour
disappears.

Article 58: Excusable delay
Delay notice of dishonour of a negotiable
instrument which is due an unforseeable
event or event of force majeure against the
party serving the notice is excused if it is
evident that it has not emanated from his or
her faults.
Article 59: Waiver of notice to payee
Notice of dishonour of a negotiable
instrument is waived if:
1° after the exercise of due diligence,

the negotiable instrument is
presented for payment;
4° the payer or the acceptor is under

instrument drawn within the country

in Rwanda which has been dishonoured
may, if necessary, cause it to be noted with

protested in order to file an action against
the drawer or endorser.

protested for non-acceptance or of which
protest for non-acceptance has been

new protest.

2° the bearer may enforce payment
against the drawer or any endorser
compelled to pay.
Article 69: Cessation of obligations
related to a negotiable instrument
Obligations based on a negotiable
instrument cease if a negotiable instrument
is paid in due course by the payer or his or
her agent.

bearer
thereof
unconditionally renounces his or her rights

payment against any party.

instrument
In the event a negotiable instrument has
been materially altered, but the alteration is
not apparent, and the instrument is in the
hands of a holder in due course, and the

CHAPTER III: BILL OF EXCHANGE
Article 77: Bill of exchange that does not
comply with the requirements
A bill of exchange that does not comply
with the requirements provided in Article
of this Law or that orders any act to be done
in addition to the payment of money is not
valid and it is not considered as a bill of
exchange.
A bill of exchange addressed to more than
one payer in succession is not a bill of
exchange.
Article 78: Omission of date on which
bill of exchange is drawn
If a bill of exchange is issued for payment
at a fixed period of time and its date of
issuance is not indicated, any holder may
insert the true date of issuance of the bill of
exchange and it is paid accordingly.
If a wrong date is inserted in a bill of
exchange and the bill of exchange comes

into the hands of a holder in due course, the
bill of exchange is not avoided, it operates
and is paid as if the date so inserted was the
true date.
Article 79: Acceptance of a bill of
exchange
Acceptance of a bill of exchange is done
through the notification by the drawee of
his or her assent to the order of the drawer.
Article 80: Error on the name of the
payer
Where there is an error on the name of the
payer or where the name is misspelt, he or
she may accept the bill of exchange as it is
and signs it.
Article 81: Requirements for a valid
acceptance of a bill of exchange
To be valid, the acceptance of a bill of
exchange must comply with the following:

1° the acceptance is written on the bill
of exchange and signed by the
drawee;
2° the acceptance which does not
express that the drawee will pay by
any means other than money.
Article 82:
acceptance
General
or
restrictive
Acceptance of a bill of exchange may be
general or restrictive.
An acceptance of a bill is general if there is
no restriction indicated on the bill of
exchange notified to the drawer.
An acceptance of a bill is restrictive if its
payment is dependent on the fulfilment of
all the conditions specified at the time of
issuance.

Article 83: Characteristics of
restrictive acceptance of a bill of
exchange
An acceptance of a bill of exchange is
restrictive when:
1° acceptor of the bill of exchange
requires certain conditions to be
fulfilled before payment;
2° acceptor of the bill of exchange
indicates that he or she will only
pay part of the amount to be paid;
3° acceptor of the bill of exchange
specifies a certain date on which
the bill has to be paid;
4° acceptance of the bill of exchange
is done by some of the payers.
Article 84: Irrevocability of acceptance
A contract on a bill of exchange made by
payer, by an acceptor or by an endorser, is
revocable until delivery of the bill of
exchange to the payee.

However, where an acceptance is written
on a bill of exchange and the payer gives
notice to the bearer who so accepts, the
acceptance of the bill of exchange then
becomes complete and irrevocable.
Article 85: Delivery of a bill of exchange
Delivery of a bill of exchange is made by:
1° the drawer;
2° the acceptor;
3° the endorser or
representative.
his
or
her
If a bill of exchange is in the hands of
holder, a valid delivery of the bill of
exchange is conclusively presumed.

Article 86: Excusable late presentation
of a bill of exchange
A drawer or endorsers of a bill of exchange
payable elsewhere than at the place of
business or residence of the drawee,
whether at his or her premises or through
electronic mail, may not invoke non-
presentation of the bill of exchange for
payment if the bearer proves that he or she
has unsuccessfully made every effort to
cause the bill of exchange to be accepted.
Article 87: Conditions for presentation
of a bill of exchange for acceptance
A bill of exchange is duly presented for
acceptance when it is presented in
accordance with the following conditions:
1° if presentation made by or on
behalf of the bearer to the drawee
or to a person authorised to accept
or refuse acceptance on his or her
behalf, at working hours and day
and before the bill of exchange is
overdue;

2° if a bill of exchange is addressed
to several drawees with no
business
relationship,
the
presentation must be made to
each of them, unless one has
authority to accept for all, in
which case the presentation may
be made to him or her only;
3° if the payer is dead, presentation
of the bill of exchange is made to
his or her heir;
4° if authorised by usage or
agreement, the presentation of
bill of exchange for acceptance is
done through a post office or any
other means of communication.

Article 88: Liability of person signing as
agent or in representative capacity
If a person signs a bill of exchange as
drawer, endorser or acceptor, and adds
words to his or her signature, indicating
that he or she signs for or on behalf of
principal, or in a representative capacity,
he or she is not personally liable. However,
the addition to his signature of words
describing him or her as an agent, or as
filling a representative capacity, does not
exempt him or her from personal liability.
When determining whether a signature on
a bill of exchange is that of the principal or
that of the agent by whose hand it is
written, the interpretation which is the
most favourable to the validity of the
instrument is adopted.
Article 89: Forged bill of exchange paid
by a financial instititution
If a bill of exchange is paid in good faith
and in the ordinary course of business, it is
not incumbent on the financial institution
to show that the endorsement of the payee
or any subsequent endorsement was made

by or under the authority of the person
whose endorsement it purports to be and
the financial institution is considered to
have paid the bill in due course even if such
endorsement has been forged or made
without authority.
Article 90: Forged or unauthorised
signature
Subject to the provisions of this Law, if
signature on a bill of exchange is forged or
placed thereon without the authority of the
person whose signature it purports to be,
the forged or unauthorised signature is
wholly void and no right to retain the bill
of exchange or to enforce payment against
any party thereto can be acquired under
that signature.
However, a party against whom it is sought
to retain the bill of exchange or enforce
payment of the bill of exchange may not
consider the forgery or require authority.

The provisions of this Article do not affect
the approval of an unauthorised signature
not amounting to a forgery.
Article 91: Time for acceptance of a bill
of exchange
The payer may accept a bill of exchange on
the day of its due presentation to him or her
for acceptance or at any time within three
(3) working days of the due date for its
acceptance.
If a bill of exchange is duly presented for
acceptance and is not accepted within the
period referred to in Paragraph One of this
Article, the bearer considers it as
dishonoured by non-acceptance.
The bearer of a bill of exchange loses the
right to recourse against the drawer or
endorsers if he or she has not presented the
bill of exchange for acceptance within the
prescribed time referred to in Paragraph
One of this Article. However, his or her
right to recourse against the drawer may
still stand in an unforseable event or in the
event of force majeure.

Article 92: Date of acceptance of a bill of
exchange
Where a bill of exchange is payable at sight
or at a fixed period of acceptance, the
acceptor may date his or her acceptance
thereon as of any of the days specified but
not later than the day of his or her actual
acceptance of the bill of exchange.
However, a bill of exchange is not invalid
by reason only that it is ante-dated or post-
dated, or that it bears date on non-working
day.
Article 93: Dishonoured and a partially
accepted foreign bill of exchange
A foreign bill of exchange that was
dishonoured due to its previous non-
acceptance must be accompanied by a duly
authenticated protest indicating non-
payment of a valid bill of exchange.

A foreign bill of exchange which was
partially accepted is subject to a protest for
the part not accepted.
Article 94: Recourse against a drawer or
an endorser
A bearer of a bill of exchange dishonoured
by non-acceptance by a drawee has the
right of recourse against the drawer or
other endorsers.
Article 95:
acceptance
Refusal
of
restrictive
The bearer of a bill of exchange may refuse
a restrictive acceptance.
If the bearer of a bill of exchange refuses
restrictive acceptance, the bill of exchange
is considered as dishonoured unless the
drawer is notified thereof without him or
her expressing his or her opposition.
Article 96: Incomplete bill of exchange
If a drawer makes a simple signature on
blank paper in order for it to be converted
into a bill of exchange, it operates as
undisputed authority to fill it up as

complete bill of exchange for any amount
the stamp will cover, using the signature
for that purpose of the drawer, the acceptor
or the endorser. If a bill of exchange lacks
any material particular, the bearer has an
undisputable authority to fill up the
omission in any way he or she thinks.
Article 97: Loss of right to recourse
against a drawer or an endorser of an
incomplete bill of exchange
When a bearer notes that a bill of exchange
is incomplete and subsequently accepts it,
he or she can institute no recourse against
the drawer and endorser unless it appears
that the bearer has been expressly or
impliedly authorised to do so or that either
party to the bill has accepted to correct it.
The provisions of Paragraph One of this
Article do not apply to a partial acceptance
notified to the bearer.

Article 98: Acceptance of a bill of
exchange for honour
If a bill of exchange that is not yet due has
been subjected to a protest or requires
better security, any person may intervene
for its acceptance.
A bill of exchange may be accepted for
honour for only part of the sum specified
on the bill of exchange.
Article 99: Requirements for acceptance
of a bill of exchange for honour
The requirements for validity of an
acceptance for honour of the bill of
exchange are the following:

2° signed by the acceptor for honour.

Article 100: Obligations of acceptor for
honour
The acceptor for honour commits to pay
the bill of exchange according to the tenor
of his or her acceptance, in case it is not
paid by the drawee. The acceptor for
honour is liable to the bearer and to all
parties to the bill of exchange subsequent
to the party for whose honour he or she has
accepted.
Article 101: Payment for honour
If a bill of exchange is not paid, any person
may intervene and pay it for the honour of
any party liable on it or for the honour of
the payer.
Article 102: Proof of payment for
honour
In order to operate as a payment for honour
and not as a mere voluntary payment, the
payment for honour is proved by a notarial
act of honour which may be appended to
the protest or form an extension of it.

The notarial act of honour is founded on
declaration made by the acceptor for
honour or his or her agent in that behalf,
stating his or her intention to pay the bill of
exchange for honour and for whose honour
he or she pays.
Article 103: Payment and subrogation
When a bill of exchange has been paid for
honour, all parties subsequent to the party
for whose honour it is paid are discharged.
The payer for honour is subrogated for and
succeeds to both the rights and duties of the
holder with respect to the party for whose
honour he or she pays and all parties liable
to that party.

a bill of exchange payable with interest
If a bill of exchange is expressed to be
payable with interest, interest accrue,
unless provided otherwise in a contract,
from the date of issue.

Article 105: Referee
The payer of a bill of exchange and an
endorser may insert in the bill of exchange
the name of the referee to whom,
necessary, the bearer may resort in case the
bill of exchange is dishonoured by non-
acceptance or non-payment.
The bearer of a bill of exchange may, if
necessary, resort to the referee.
