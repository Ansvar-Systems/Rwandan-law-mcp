PRELIMINARY
Article One: Purpose of this Law
This Law governs the civil, commercial,

The subject-matter of the claim is determined
by parties’ respective arguments. Arguments
are laid down in the document instituting
proceedings and in the defence submissions
and are definitely confirmed during the pretrial
conference, where applicable.
No party may modify the subject-matter in the
course of the proceedings unless such
modification is agreed upon by all parties
the case.
The subject-matter cannot be changed before
the appellate court. However, the subject-
matter may be changed by incidental claims
these are sufficiently linked to the original
arguments of parties.

Article 7: Claimant’s obligations
The claimant has the following obligations:
1° to deposit court fees, unless otherwise
provided by law;
2° to provide his/her full identity and
physical address, including the e-mail

francs for delaying tactics.
The fine referred to in paragraph 2 of this
Article is ordered by the court registrar
presiding over the pretrial conference and
approved by the order of the president of the
court.
If the fine referred to in this Article is not paid
before the commencement of the hearing
process, the fine is included in the court’s
decision.

Article 9: Judges’ obligation to adjudicate
cases
A judge adjudicates a case on the basis of
relevant rules of law. In the absence of such
rules, the judge adjudicates according to the
rules that he/she would establish if he/she had
to act as legislator, relying on precedents,
customs, general principles of law and
doctrine.
A judge cannot refuse to decide a case on any
pretext of silence, obscurity or insufficiency of
the law.
A judge may encourage parties to use
conciliation if he/she believes that conciliation
is the most appropriate way to resolve the
dispute. He/she may him/herself mediate
between the parties or help them find
mediator of their choice and postpones the
hearing for the entire duration of conciliation.
A judge can in no way base on foreign courts’
decisions or legal doctrine if such decisions or

doctrine conflict with public order or the
Rwandan legal system.
Article 10: Decide on what has been asked
A judge may not decide more than he/she has
been asked to.
Article 11: Facts that are not considered
while adjudicating a case
A judge cannot base his/her decision on the
facts which have not been raised during the
hearing. Neither can he/she decide a case on
the basis of personal knowledge of the case.
Article 12: Burden of proof
The claimant must prove a claim, failing
which the respondent wins the case.
Likewise, a party who alleges that he/she has
been discharged from an obligation
established by evidence must justify the cause
as a result of which the obligation has

extinguished. Failure to do so, the other party
wins the case.
Article 13: Right to be heard
No party can be tried except after having been
heard or summoned.
Article 14: Decision having acquired the
force of res judicata
A case having been definitively decided
cannot again be litigated for the same facts,
between the same parties acting with respect
to the same cause.
Article 15: Prohibition to avail oneself of
two remedies at the same time
No party can avail him/herself of two remedies
or apply for review with respect to the same
case. The first remedy chosen causes the party
to lose the right to avail him/herself of other
remedies.

Article 16: Time limit for deciding a case
Any case referred to the court must be decided
within six (6) months from the date the claim
is referred to the court.
With the exception of urgent claims and at any
time it is considered necessary in the interests
of the administration of justice, the hearing
date for all cases is set according to the order
of registration thereof on the list of cases.
Article 17: Adjournment of a case
The adjournment of a case for reasons specific
to parties is subject to consideration and
approval by the court and can only occur
case of unforeseen and special reasons.
The adjournment of a case for reasons specific
to parties cannot occur more than twice. After
the adjournment has taken place twice, the

the hearing on the merits, the judge fixes the
date and time of the hearing of the disowning

case, and takes a decision before the main
hearing. In that case, the main hearing

other than those from the East African
Community, whether acting as original
claimants or intervening in the case upon
application by the claimant, before any other
objections raised in the case, must deposit an
amount of security which is enough to satisfy
the costs and damages that might arise from
the case, unless there are agreements entered
into between foreign States and Rwanda which
exempt their nationals from depositing such
security.
The respondent may also request that the
security be furnished for the first time on
appeal.
A foreign respondent in a case is exempted
from furnishing monetary security if he/she

determines modalities for payment and
amount thereof.

fifteen (15) days.
Article 94: Appeal against a decision on
objection regarding the lack of jurisdiction
A party dissatisfied with the court’s decision
on the objection regarding the lack of
jurisdiction must appeal against the decision
within five (5) days. The appellate court
decides on the appeal within fifteen (15) days
from the filing of the appeal.

If the court holds that it has jurisdiction, the
dissatisfied party appeals against it together
with the case on the merits.
If the appellate court concludes that the trial
court ruled that it has no jurisdiction while
was competent, the appellate court resends the
file to the court having heard the case in the
first instance for hearing the case on the merits
without paying other court fees.
The court to which the case is transferred
cannot refuse to hear the case under pretext
that it has decided on its lack of jurisdiction.
If the appellate court finds that the case was
filed with the trial court contrary to law, but
the court has admitted the case while it should
not, the appellate court admits such a case and
rules that the case was filed with the first court
in a manner contrary to law and invalidates all
decisions taken on the basis of that mistake
and any interested party may file the case
afresh.

to the president of the court and the president
takes an administrative decision.
The decision on such appeal is taken within
forty-eight (48) hours, and is not open
another appeal. The decision is put into the
case file and communicated to all parties.
If such objections are admitted and it
concluded that there are two claims
concerning the same subject-matter which are
pending before different courts, or that there
are related claims which are pending before
different courts, the decision taken indicates
the competent court to hear those cases.
In that case, the cases are forwarded to the
court which must decide them without

payment of any other court fees and, where
necessary,
parties
complement
their
submissions before being invited to the pretrial
conference.
If it is ruled that the objections are not
admitted, the pretrial conference resumes.

one who appears, the court makes its decision
based on the elements contained in former
judgement and the grounds of defense of the
opposing party.
When a party who applied for the opposition

request for the confirmation of the first
judgement without prejudice to the fact that he
or she can ask for the damages equivalent

The respondent in appeal court may also have
some claims to be made in his or her defense.
A cross appeal is filed by the respondent
against the appellant or against other
respondents.

principal appeal does not prevent the appellant
from seeking for legal fees.
A cross appeal shall not be subject to the
deposit of court fees.

Article 153: Appeal of some of the parties
If some of the parties made an appeal to the
judgement and others have not done so, it does
not prevent the court to summon all of them
appeal.

interests. They can also make an incidental
appeal to make some claims, as well they may
lose those to which they are entitled to the first
judgement.
Article 154: Prohibition of filing new claims

appeal level.
Article 157: Decision on the appealed
judgement
The appeal court may overrule the appealed
judgement in all its clauses or some of them,
uphold the rendered judgement or set aside the
judgement.

The appeal court tries the case in merits unless:

by a court lacking jurisdiction;
2° the court declared lack of jurisdiction
while it had jurisdiction;
3° there was irregularity in referring the
matter to the court.
Article 158: To set aside the appealed
judgement
When the appeal court finds that the first-
instance court has been seized irregularly or
the court seized is not competent, but the lower
court has decided to decide on the case
whereas it should not; the appeal court
receives that appeal and motivates that the
appeal case was irregularly filed at the first
level, and the appellate court quashes all the
decisions taken on the basis of this error; the
interested party may file a new claim.
However, if the appeal court finds that the
seizure of jurisdiction at the first degree was
lawful and that court declared it inadmissible

when it was to receive and judge this case, the
court of appeal hears the case and declares that
it was of the competence of that lower court;
declares this judgement void and refers the
case to the first instance court so that it hears
it again on the merits, without payment of any
other court fees.
The court to which the case was referred
cannot refuse to rule on the case, on the
grounds that it has already ruled on it for
incompetence.
Article 159: Suspension of execution of
judgement due to appeal
In case the time limit of lodging an appeal
provided for by the law has not yet elapsed or
where the appeal has been lodged, the
