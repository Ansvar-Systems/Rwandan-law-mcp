surplus is distributed as follows:
1° at least fifty percent (50%) of the net
surplus is assigned as dividend to
members, but one half (½) of this is paid
out to members and the other half (½) is
retained in the cooperative to increase the
share of a member in the capital;

2° not more than ten percent (10%) of the net
surplus is deposited into the education and

interests and assets of the cooperative if the
