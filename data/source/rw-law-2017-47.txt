discharge and decide to close out the

from any liability for actions carried out or
omitted by him/her during the management
of the bank undergoing liquidation.
However, that declaration does not
discharge the liquidator’s liability if, after
declaration, it is found the proof of fraud or

Central Bank which determines their
subsequent use.
